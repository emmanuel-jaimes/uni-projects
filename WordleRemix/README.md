## Wordle for Nerdles

## Description
This implementation of the popular New York Times Wordle gives it a twist to provide comfort with a peaceful background and multiple rounds of words to guess for one session. In this version you can guess up to 5 words of the day and get a score for your overall performance that day. Just like the NYT Wordle, the words for the day will reset the following day. 

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Support
Enjoy it or not, you can venmo the contributors and help get them through college (:
